  description: 'The Explorer is a modest spacecraft built for reliable interstellar
    travel rather than luxury or speed. Her simple hull plating, reinforced with
    standard durasteel bulkheads, glides steadily through vacuum and navigates asteroid
    fields with dependable resilience.

    

    This no-frills vessel features
    basic ion thrusters that provide efficient, if not impressive, propulsion through
    the cosmos. The bridge is uncluttered and functional, with essential navigation
    systems secured in practical configurations. A small observation deck offers
    views of the stars, while the lower compartments provide cramped but adequate
    living quarters for a minimal crew.'
